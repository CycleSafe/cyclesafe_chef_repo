Just make your changes directly into the zemadi/CycleSafe_deploy repo. 

Test by going to cyclesafe.com (or your url that you chose) in your browser. No need to restart the machine.

# FAQ

- What if the db password needs to change?

Any major system changes require running "vagrant destroy && vagrant up". Otherwise, "vagrant reload --provision" restarts the machine just fine.

- What if I need to change django code?

Well, two options. Change the code and then run "vagrant provision" or log with "vagrant ssh" and go to root with "sudo su" and run "supervisorctl restart cyclesafe" once you've made your changes in the local repo.
